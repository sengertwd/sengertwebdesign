Sengert WD is a small blog about web design and coding. There will be tutorials about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bunch of other topics.

Code will appear in a field like the following:

{% highlight javascript %}$("document").ready(function(){
  $("body").remove();
});
{% endhighlight %}

HTML Example: 

{% highlight html %}
<div>
  <span>This is some content.</span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
