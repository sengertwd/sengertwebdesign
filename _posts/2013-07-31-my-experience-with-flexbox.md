### My thoughts on flexbox
Just the other day I was working on a prototype for a site for one of my designer friends and wanted to try to use one of the newer technologies. I chose to use flexbox for the prototype because it was both a newer technology and it has better support than most of the other new CSS3 layouts. As I was trying to figure out how to use flexbox I realized that I found myself wondering why they used the different CSS values and I found myself a little confused on what everything did. I know part of the fault falls on me because I was just learning how to use flexbox, but another part has to do with what the value really were for the CSS.

Do not get me wrong, I think that flexbox is absolutely great, I just wish that some of the properties made more sense. 

{% highlight html %}
.style{
	color:#f90aff;
	position:absolute;
}
{% endhighlight %}
