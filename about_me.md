# About Me
## Where I'm from
I am San Diego, CA native born here. One year after I was born we moved to Chicago, IL. Where I lived for nearly 10 years. After those ten years, my family and  moved back to sunny San Diego, where we have lived since. 


## How did I get into Web Development. Design, and other computer stuff...
Well It began after we moved to San Diego and I met my best friend of nearly 10 who was always into computers and all that fun stuff. His interest sparked mine to learn a little bit into computers and all that fun stuff. It originally started with wanting to learn how to build my own video game. At the time being no older than 14, I picked up [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org/) which was the only thing that I could learn at the time.


After learning a little bit in the old blender interface I gave up on that and began to pursue my own goals with computers. I eventually found myself looking at websites and Sitting on facebook(which is where I spent a lot of my time at the age of 17) thinking to myself, "It cannot be that hard to learn how to do this stuff" which sparked my imagination. I soon after began learning how to make a **easy** website that was just plain html with no styling or any formatting. 


After learning how to do that I eventually moved onto making a table layout Web Page, in 2010. Yeah, I know, way out of date. From there I quit using html and CSS and went back to using Facebook, YouTube, and working on tiny little 3D projects using Blender yet again. 


After graduating High School, I immediately went straight to the local community college. My major going into college was Business, which I soon after the first semester was not for me and I would have to switch my major. After my first semester, I took mainly general education Classes. But the following fall I began my journey as a student in the web world. The reason that made me switch to the Web Design major is that I had recently started making websites again and was pleasantly surprised by all that I was learning, partly due to my best friend who was creating a website for someone else. 


 I became facinated with front end web development and design, though at that point I was never good at design. I had just started using div's and other elements that were not table layouts. As I was learning this, My best friend kept telling me about these **awesome** new css properties that allowed me to make rounded corners on an element or have a gradient as the background of an element. This is what completely sold me into working with the Web. 


During the first semester in my web classes, I took Intro to Web which taught all the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 but before the class I had already learned a lot about both of these, so I was way ahead of all of that class even my new friends who also knew how to work with the web. After less that a month in class, my teacher told me about an internship a company that he could hook me up with. I found myself at [Digitaria](http://www.digitaria.com/) doing an interview for an internship. Right after the interview I was immediately brought on and intern and started interning the following week. 


At the time of writing this, I am still employed as an intern at Digitaria and love working and talking with the people there.
